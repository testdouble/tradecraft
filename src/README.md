a.k.a. "TDTropes", lessons learned on the set of everyone's favorite software development-themed spy movie.

This is the introduction to this awesome book.

### Goals {#goals}

These are the goals of the book.

- Informative resource for consultants.
- Define a language to facilitate collaboration between consultants.
- Show potential pitfalls of contracting and consulting to potential clients.

### How to read this book {#how-to}

The book is intended to be an on-going reference. As such, the goal of the first read-through should not be to digest the entire book in one go. Rather, it's best to read through Purposes in its entirety, skimming Processes and Patterns so that you know where to find information in the future.

When you find yourself prsented with a new or difficult challenge, digging Processes and Patterns can be useful to help inform the strategy you employ to tackle the problem. The Purposes section should be reviewed periodically for each account, ensuring that deployed consultants are keeping this "big picture" in mind.
