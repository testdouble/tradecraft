# Purposes

In 1982 _Harvard Business Review_ published a paper titled [_Consulting Is More Than Giving Advice_][hbr-consulting-paper], in which professor Arthur M. Turner describes the eight fundamental objectives of management consultants. Thirty-five years later and with a _major_ jump in field, those same eight objectives still ring with truth in our roles as software development consultants.

1. Providing information to a client.
2. Solving a client’s problems.
3. Making a diagnosis, which may necessitate redefinition of the problem.
4. Making recommendations based on the diagnosis.
5. Assisting with implementation of recommended solutions.
6. Building a consensus and commitment around corrective action.
7. Facilitating client learning—that is, teaching clients how to resolve similar problems in the future.
8. Permanently improving organizational effectiveness.

### Our 8 Goals

We split this into three levels according to what we see and expect from Contractors, Consultants, and Where Consulting _Should_ Be.

Contracting:
1. Providing information to a client.
2. Solving a client’s problems.
Consulting:
3. Making a diagnosis, which may necessitate redefinition of the problem.
4. Making recommendations based on the diagnosis.
5. Assisting with implementation of recommended solutions.
Should Be:
6. Building a consensus and commitment around corrective action.
7. Facilitating client learning—that is, teaching clients how to resolve similar problems in the future.
8. Permanently improving organizational effectiveness.

- [ ] Customized purposes.
- [ ] Examples for each purpose.
- [ ] Better labels for groups.

Here we will summarize those 8 points from the perspective of software development consulting.

Here we will discuss the need to push for "higher levels" of consulting.

Here we should talk about how the Patterns help #3, #4, and #5.

Here we should talk about how the Processes help #6, #7, and #8.
